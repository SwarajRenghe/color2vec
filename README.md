# Color2Vec

Built a word vector for color hex data avaliable at XKCD's colors corpora at https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/colors/xkcd.json

Inspired by Allison Parrish's "Understanding word vectors for, like, actual poets" at https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469

## To Do
Build methods to save the word embeddings to disk. 

Build methods to access the word embeddings.
